# Introduction 

In this class we are going to conduct a research project using genomic data to figure out how a set of species are related (i.e. build phylogenies).
Start by watching the Preview and episodes 1, 5, 12, and 14 in this [series on animal evolution](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNRgJI4gHRLFtOD_r4hfJaF).

## Phylogenies

For a more detailed explanation of phylogenies go through the following [course](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/introduction-to-phylogenetics/#vf-tabs__section--contents).  

Now that you've seen some phylogenies and how they are used, here's another example of a simply phylogeny of some groups of vertebrates.
Remember, 
the tree-like structure allows you to tell how closely related species are.

Use this phylogeny to practive tracing back who shares recent and not-so-recent common ancestors.
For example, do mammals and birds share a common ancestor more recently than snakes and mammals?
Also practice using the noted trait evolution to think about which groups have which characteristics.

If you'd like a little more practice, here's another [resource](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/the-history-of-life-looking-at-the-patterns/).
