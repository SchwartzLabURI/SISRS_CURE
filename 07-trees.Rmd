# Building Trees

## Phylogenetic Data

You now have alignments of variable sites useful for building phylogenies.
If you aren't sure what that means refer back to some of the earlier materials.

## Building trees from your data (concatenation)

We will take a simple "concatenation" approach to analyzing your data.
That means we will analyze all the sites together and expect them to come from one evolutionary history.
There are more complex ways to consider the data, including different histories and different models that you can try later.

Edit the `runRaxml.sh` slurm script for your data and submit it.
This will generate plain text files of the best estimate of the phylogeny for your data using a Maximum Likelihood algorithm.

## Building trees from your data (Multispecies coalescent)

Another approach to use is a method modeling multispecies coalescent. SVDQuartets is one of such methods, specifically designed to work with site-based data.
A nexus file can be used as an input to the program. Create an empty file which will become a slurm script that runs the program. Paste the following content in it:
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="svdq"
#SBATCH --time=150:00:00  # walltime limit (HH:MM:SS)
#SBATCH --nodes=1   # number of nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1   # processor core(s) per node
#SBATCH -c 36

#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email

cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
module load PAUP/4.0a168-centos64

alignmentFile="svdquartets_tutorial/anomaly_zone.nex"
logFile="svdq.log"
treeFile="svdq.tre"

nBoot=1000
nCpus=36

date

echo "
svdq bootstrap nreps=${nBoot} nthreads=${nCpus};
saveTrees file=${treeFile};
quit;
" | paup ${alignmentFile} -L ${logFile}

date
```
Adjust the email, the number of processors if needed (`#SBATCH -c` value should correspond to `nCpus` value), path and name of the input file (`alignmentFile`), and submit the script as sbatch job.

## Visualizing trees

* Download [Figtree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases) to your personal computer.
* Download the file labeled RAxML_bipartitions (with the suffix for your analysis) (for the concatenation analysis) or `svdq.tre` (for the SVDQuartets multispecies coalescent analysis) to your personal computer.
* Open your tree file in Figtree
* Root tree using your outgroup.
* Look at bootstrap support on each node.
