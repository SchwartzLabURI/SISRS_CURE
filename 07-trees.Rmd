# Building Trees

## Phylogenetic Data

You now have alignments of variable sites useful for building phylogenies.
If you aren't sure what that means refer back to some of the earlier materials.

## Building trees from your data (concatenation)

We will take a simple "concatenation" approach to analyzing your data.
That means we will analyze all the sites together and expect them to come from one evolutionary history.
There are more complex ways to consider the data, including different histories and different models that you can try later.

Edit the `slurm_submissions/runRaxml.sh` slurm script for your data and submit it.
This will generate plain text files of the best estimate of the phylogeny for your data using a Maximum Likelihood algorithm.

## Building trees from your data (Multispecies coalescent)

Edit the `slurm_submissions/runSVDQ.sh` slurm script for your data and submit it.

Adjust the email, the number of processors if needed, path and name of the input file (`alignmentFile`), and submit the script as sbatch job.

## Visualizing trees

* Download the file that starts with RAxML_bipartitions (with the suffix for your analysis) (for the concatenation analysis) or `svdq.tre` (for the SVDQuartets multispecies coalescent analysis) to your personal computer.
  - On a Mac:
    * Open a new tab in your Terminal
    * cd to a folder on your local computer where you want to keep your results
    * type `scp [username]@ssh3.hac.uri.edu:[full path to your file]` .
  - On a PC:
    * Download [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) to allow file transfers to your computer.
    * Click Open Connection
    * Select SFTP
    * Enter `ssh3.hac.uri.edu` as the server, your username, and select your ssh key
    * Once connected find the file in the folder and download it

* Download [Figtree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases) to your personal computer.

* Open your tree file in Figtree
* Root tree using your outgroup (click on the species and click Reroot).
* Look at bootstrap support on each node by changing the Node Label to `label`.
