## What does your tree tell you?

Use the following guide to begin to understand your research results:

* Describe your hypothesis and a potential alternative. Draw from your introduction. Include both the potential phylogenetic hypotheses based on prior research and morphological results that would suggest.

* Explain how your results support or contradict your phylogenetic hypotheses. Your description may include more than one set of relationships. If relevant explain how your results support / contradict your morphological hypotheses.

* Explain how your results support or contradict prior results from other papers.

* How can future research build on these observations?

* What is your general conclusion from your results?
