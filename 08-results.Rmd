# Results

## What does your tree tell you?

* Compare your tree to prior results found in the literature.
* Go back to the first readings you did and continue to explore.
* Are your results novel (e.g. have you determined relationships among species that no one had investigated)?
* Do your results confirm or refute prior work?
