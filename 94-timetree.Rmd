# Citations using TimeTree {-}

An alternate point to start for phylogenetic research is the website [TimeTree](http://timetree.org/).

1. Put the scientific name of your group in the Specify a Group of Taxa box. You may need to look up your group first on Google or Wikipedia.
2. Click Search then Show Timetree
3. Look for ambiguities in the tree (shown as multiple branches coming from a single node). Don't worry if you don't see any though. If only results from a single study are entered the results would appear unambiguous even if uncertainties can be found.
4. Pick a couple of taxon names and write them down. Try to encompass the history of your group.
5. Go back to the main TimeTree page and enter your taxa in the boxes for Specify 2 Taxon Names.
6. Scroll down for the literature that supports the resulting phylogeny.
