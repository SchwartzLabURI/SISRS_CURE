"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Phylogenies", " Chapter 2 Introduction In this class we are going to conduct a research project using genomic data to figure out how a set of species are related (i.e. build phylogenies). Start by watching the Preview and episodes 1, 5, 12, and 14 in this series on animal evolution. 2.1 Phylogenies For a more detailed explanation of phylogenies go through the following course. Now that you’ve seen some phylogenies and how they are used, here’s another example of a simply phylogeny of some groups of vertebrates. Remember, the tree-like structure allows you to tell how closely related species are. Use this phylogeny to practive tracing back who shares recent and not-so-recent common ancestors. For example, do mammals and birds share a common ancestor more recently than snakes and mammals? Also practice using the noted trait evolution to think about which groups have which characteristics. If you’d like a little more practice, here’s another resource.

Our understanding of how species are related is constantly changing. That means that you can play a role you can play in determining how evolution happened. You can pick any group to study or ask your instructor for suggestions. Once you pick a group you’ll need to investigate it a bit more to determine whether you can narrow your research to address particularly interesting research questions, and then determine whether there are data to help you answer those questions. You might consider picking a group that is studied by URI faculty. If you still need ideas click here. 3.2 Learning about your group You will need to do some background research to learn about the group you propose to study, and to provide motivation of your work. Check out the URI Library’s Basics of College Level Research. 3.2.1 Finding research articles To get started find out something about your group. You can start with Google, although you should rapidly move on to searching the primary literature. Learn about scholarly and popular sources to understand why you need to go beyond popular or secondary literature. Also check out the URI Library’s discussion on why not just search Google. For general suggestions on finding literature on your topic see the URI Library’s guide to finding journal articles. The URI Library offers a variety of databases for research, but Google Scholar can be a good way to find literature on your topic. How to use Google Scholar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bUS9TYvRU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vSE-_iq7NE URI’s guide to Google Scholar If you are struggling to find papers that seem relevant to your research topic try the URI Library’s guide to developing an effective search strategy. An alternate point to start looking for papers with phylogenies for your research is outlined here. When you find an article you want, you can access it as a member of the URI community. However, if you are off campus the journal may not recognize you. In Google Scholar click the menu bar in the upper left and choose settings. Search for the University of Rhode Island and select URI library. Google Scholar will now have Search @ URI Libraries on the right if there’s an article you want. If you still have problems you may need to search for you article via the library website. Go to https://web.uri.edu/library/. Under Find Resources paste the name of an article of interest and Search. Find the online resource that allows you to have access and sign in with your URI login. If URI has access to the article you should be able to read it. You may need to repeat your search on the URI website for other articles depending on your connection. 3.2.2 Reading research articles Once you locate a paper to read you need to read it. Check out these recommendations on how to read a paper efficiently and effectively: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv5ku0eoY6k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeaD0ZaUJ3Y 3.2.3 Reading for your research In class we will start to search for and read background material using the Citation Tracking Activity. After some background research you may have a preliminary idea of which group to study, and hopefully you have a good reason for this group. Keep in mind that you may be fascinated by a particular group of species, but you still have to convince others to be equally fascinated. If you aren’t sure, try explaining your project to a friend or roommate. Also check out past projects for example research questions. 3.2.4 More background information Now that you have a group of species and a (possibly vague) question you can begin to write your ideas. You won’t have everything pinned down precisely, but write down what you have. Let’s research your group a bit more. First, find out more about your group, particularly the number of species and its age, by looking at Wikipedia and searching Google. If you picked a group that has a lot of species (e.g. birds, mammals), see if you can pick a smaller clade within your group of interest. You can also find out more about the species in your group by searching the TimeTree. 3.3 Freewrite assignment At this point you should have a lot of ideas in your head. Now is the time to write them down. When scientists plan their research project they typically do a lot of writing. In this end this kind of writing turns into a formal research proposal, but the process of shaping that proposal usually starts with lots of notes about (1) what the researcher thinks the question is at the beginning, and (2) what is known in the field from reading a lot of papers. You are going to work through this process now to make a plan for your own research. First, write 1-2 pages of what you think your question is, why it’s interesting, and what is known in the field. If writing makes you think your question has already been answered, or needs more work before you can answer it, write all that down. You have two options here, first to truly freewrite your thoughts and see how they evolve and change, and second to go back and change your question if you discover it needs refinement. Either way, don’t get bogged down in details or grammar - try to get your ideas and background onto the paper. You should use this assignment to seek your plan and question yourself as to whether it will be successful. Think about this piece of work like an artist’s sketchbook that requires multiple tries to produce something that seems good. We will use this writing for discussion in class where you will have a chance to get comments so that you can have the best research plan moving forward. A successful freewrite will make you feel like you have a question and plan that will stand up to skeptical questioning by your peers. 3.4 Annotated Bibliography assignment Once you really know what you want to work on, you should make sure you understand the background to your research. That means reading the primary literature in more depth. An annotated bibliography can help you organize your understanding of this material. Develop an annotated bibliography of at least 5 sources. Note that you may need to skim 10-20 papers before settling on 5 to read in depth. See suggestions above for how to find and read papers. Your annotated bibliography should include the full citation (and probably a link for later use) followed by a 1-2 paragraph summary and/or bullets of the important points (particularly results) in the article as they relate to your research. The format is not critical. Note that an annotated bibliography is not an abstract. The annotated bibliography is for you to use later so take notes on what’s important for your research. Here are some examples and references: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/annotated_bibliography_samples.html https://guides.library.cornell.edu/annotatedbibliography 3.5 Reflection assignment Write a short reflection on your annotatated bibliography. Why did you select the papers you chose to read more in depth? Why did you feel that the remaining papers were less relevant? Do you feel that your research question is strong and well motivated? Explain why. "],["getting-data.html", "Chapter 4 Getting Data", " Chapter 4 Getting Data Once you have settled on a group that you are interested in studying you need to find out if there are data to help you answer your research questions. We’ll be using genome sequence data to determine the species relationships in your group. Read the following to learn more about sequencing and molecular phylogenetics: 2nd generation sequencing Genomes ch. 16 To acquire molecular data to compare the species in your group you either need to do a lot of sequencing, or find sequencing someone else has done. Becuase sequencing takes time and money we’ll try using data that is already available and just hasn’t been analyzed to answer the questions you are interested in. Go to the European Nucleotide Archive Learn more about ENA here Select: Data type: Raw Reads Query: pick taxonomy (include subordinate) Add to query box: AND instrument_platform=&quot;ILLUMINA&quot; AND (library_strategy=&quot;RNA-Seq&quot; OR library_strategy=&quot;WGS&quot;) Fields: scientific_name, base_count, fastq_ftp Click Download report tsv Now you have a list of available data and relevant information to get it. It should look the same as what you saw in your browser. You can open this file in Excel or Google Sheets. It might look like you have a lot of data, but it’s actually hard to tell from this page. You might have a lot of data for one or a few species and not enough to analyze your whole group. To figure out which data you will need sort this list of samples by scientific_name. For each species (scientific_name column) you will need about 10 times the amount of bases as the size of the genome (i.e. you should have on average about 10 sequence fragments covering each base in the genome). To figure out how many bases you need use Google and Google Scholar to find the size of the genome of one of your species. Now that you know how many bases you need select the samples you want (for a total of 10x coverage) and save those in a separate sheet. The video on sequencing explains how the two ends of each genome fragment are sequenced. That means that most of your samples have two files to download. These are both listed in the fastq_ftp column. Highlight the fastq_ftp column, right-click, and select insert. Use Text-to-column in the Data menu to separate the column in two based on a semicolon. Once you are satisfied with the species you can work, use Google to find a species that is related, but not included in, your group. For example, if you are studying Primates you might select a rabbit as a related species. Go back to the ENA and find data for this species and add the appropriate lines to your download script. "],["computational-skills.html", "Chapter 5 Computational skills 5.1 Access from off campus (optional) 5.2 On a Mac 5.3 On a PC 5.4 Basic navigation", " Chapter 5 Computational skills The data you are working with is too large to analyze by hand. For example, the human genome is 3.2 billion bases. It would be hard to compare all that data to data from other species just using your eyes. Instead we’re going to need to learn some basic programming skills so we can tell the computer how to work with our data. First, you’ll have noticed that the computer we’re using doesn’t have the graphical interface you usually use (like a PC or Mac). That means you have to type in your commands - you can’t point and click. This actually has a hidden benefit because it’s easy to write down what you did in a line of text rather than having to try to explain where to click on each step. Let’s start by learning how to log in the our server and run commands without clicking. 5.1 Access from off campus (optional) Please go to https://security.uri.edu/duo/. There you will find instructions detailing how to enroll in DUO andset up Cisco AnyConnect. Make sure to follow the directions step by step and make a note of any issues or roadblocks so that you can report them to ITS Security Services. After installing and connecting to the VPN, please verify that you can connect to your specific network resources from home that you need to access. If you need to request VPN access prior to following these instructions see https://security.uri.edu/vpn/ 5.2 On a Mac 5.2.1 Getting access open your Terminal (you may need to search for it) follow the instructions under Generating an SSH Key at https://web.uri.edu/hpc-research-computing/using-andromeda/ 5.2.2 Log in to the server In your Terminal at the prompt type ssh -l username ssh3.hac.uri.edu , replacing username with the first part of your email address. You should see a prompt with ssh3 5.2.3 Video tutorials For a review or clarification of the above and some information you will use later, check out the https://its.uri.edu/research-computing-center/research-seminars/ (scroll down past Seminars to Training). 5.3 On a PC Download and install Putty. open Putty follow the instructions under Generating an SSH Key at https://web.uri.edu/hpc-research-computing/using-andromeda/ In the box marked Host Name type ssh3.hac.uri.edu, replacing username with the first part of your email address.

First, you’ll need to learn to navigate around only by typing. Computing clusters typically require you to type all the commands. For example, to list all the files in your home folder (where you are when you log in) type ls. There probably isn’t anything in this folder right now. This is just like opening a folder in a Finder window on a Mac or a folder on a PC, except you had to type the command instead of simply double clicking. Second (and to help you get used to typing instead of clicking), let’s find out where we are in the folder structure. You should be in your home folder, which is inside another folder, and so on and so forth. Think of it as a highly organized filing cabinet, and you will need to move in between folders to access files. Type pwd to see the folder you are in. You’ll see your folder at the end, preceeded by a slash, preceeded by another folder, and so on. Your home folder is on a relatively small disk, so for all of our subsequent work we will use a large storage disk. This disk contains everyone’s data, organized by research lab. You change the directory using the cd command. To get to the main folder for the Schwartz lab you need to changed directories using the cd command. Unlike the prior commands you learned, but like most commands you’ll use, this command also takes an argument, which is another “word” that comes after this command. In this case you need the argument is the “path” to the folder. Type cd /data/schwartzlab. Let’s start by making a new folder to put your work in. Use the mkdir command to make a new directory. When you make a directory you need to name it, so instead of just mkdir you need mkdir newfolder or some other folder name. This is a shared lab folder so you should make a folder with your username. For example I might type mkdir rsschwartz. From now on I will refer to this as your main folder. Move into your folder (use cd) and make a new folder called data. Now that you have a new folder move into it. Type pwd again. Notice what folder you are in. To go back to the folder containing your current folder type cd .., which will take you one level up in the folder hierarchy. Type pwd again to see where you are now. Now that you have seen a few commands check out the Cheatsheet of commands at the end of the book for future reference. "],["getting-your-data.html", "Chapter 6 Getting your data 6.1 Download", " Chapter 6 Getting your data 6.1 Download Move into your data folder in your main folder with cd. If you aren’t continuing from the last chapter you may need to use the full path to your main folder. Our next step will be to download the data you want to work with onto Bluewaves. First we need to create a script to make this happen. A script is a detailed set of instructions for the computer to follow. Your script is going to be a series of instructions to download files and put them in particular folders so you can access them. We are going to use the program nano, which is built into the system, to write this script. Type nano download_data.sh. Again, we have a command followed by an argument (in this case the name of the file we are creating). Notice how the file ends in .sh. Just like you have files that end in .xls or .doc this tells the computer the file is a shell script. Commands in your shell script and just like commands on the command line. For each file you want to download type the following (separated by spaces) on a single line: wget The ftp link -P the scientific name (as one word without spaces) Repeat with the second ftp link for the sample if it has one. Repeat this process for each sample you want to download. Exit nano using ctrl-x and save your changes. There are many people doing work on the cluster so we need take advantage of the computing power of the cluster so that each student in the class can run their analysis on a separate computer. When you log in to the cluster you are on the “head node”. From here you can submit jobs to run analyses on the other nodes attached to the cluster. In order to communicate information about your job to the cluster you need to add the following lines to the beginning of your download script. #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=&quot;download&quot; #SBATCH --time=150:00:00 # walltime limit (HH:MM:SS) #SBATCH --nodes=1 # number of nodes #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=36 # processor core(s) per node #SBATCH --mail-user=&quot;rsschwartz@uri.edu&quot; cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR Replace the email address on the second-to-last line with yours. Quit nano and save. Submit your job as sbatch download_data.sh. You can monitor the progress of your download by listing the contents of your data folder and the contents of the folders inside it. "],["phylogenetic-markers.html", "Chapter 7 Phylogenetic markers 7.1 SISRS", " Chapter 7 Phylogenetic markers 7.1 SISRS In your main folder (cd back there if you need to) type git clone https://github.com/SchwartzLabURI/SISRS.git to download the software we will use to analyze your data. Since you only have to do this once don’t worry about details beyond the idea that you are downloading a program. Now we need to work with scripts (just like before) to run each step of the analysis. Move into the SISRS folder and then the scripts folder inside that. Slurm is the name of the software used to keep track of all the jobs you submit. Use nano to open slurm_submissions/1_submit.slurm. Change all the lines marked CHANGE to be relevant to your work. Exit nano and save the script. Submit your first job as sbatch slurm_submissions/1_submit.slurm. You will get an email when your job is done. Continue to edit scripts and submit jobs for steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, and 7, changing the information as with the first script. Wait for each script to report that it has completed before continuing to the next step and do not continue if your recieve any error messages. You will also need to change the ntasks-per-node line to 20 and use 20 processors any time that information is requested. Look for lines marked CHANGE. At the last step list several numbers for the missing flag in the range of approximately half of your species. 7.1.1 What SISRS does The software we have just used automates the process of identifying orthologous genetic markers. This means that we get regions of each genome from each species that are similar based on ancestry. For example, if one of these regions was a particular gene, we’d be able to say we have found the same gene for each species, and species that have a very similar sequence for this gene are closely related, while species that are different are much less closely related. We need lots of different regions of the genome because different parts of the genome can have different information. For instance, one gene may be nearly identical for a group of closely related species but different enough to help us with relationships among more distantly related species. I’ll refer to these useful pieces of the genome as loci from here on out, as a generic term for all the types of DNA that make up the genome. See Wikipedia for these different genomic elements. We step through our analysis in the following way: Set up our analysis. This step makes all the folders we need for the analysis so we keep our data and results organized. Trim reads. Remember that when you get your data you don’t get the whole genome in one stretch. You actually get lots of little pieces of the genome. When the data comes off the sequencer the sequencer has the potential to make mistakes, especially at the end of the run and the reagents run out. We want to check each read for sloppy sequencing and get rid of any obvious errors. Get parts of the genome that are shared among species. We find these pieces by doing a genome assembly from all of our samples. A normal genome assembly would try to assembly one genome from the sequencing of one sample. Our approach will be to see what assembles from a small sample of each species combined. We expect that the only regions that assemble will be those that have information from multiple samples and are similar. Get each locus sequence for each species. Our assembly produced a bunch of loci that should be found in each of our species. But for each locus we only have one “average” sequence. Now we need to get the sequence for each locus for each species. To do this we need to go back to our original sequence data for each species and compare it to the sequence we have for each locus. By doing this we will produce the sequence for each locus for each species. As we go through this process we want to make sure we have good information, so if there is conflicting information at a site (for example if it is heterozygous) we won’t use it. Filter the dataset. Our whole collection of loci is a lot of data. At some sites all species are the same. Those sites don’t tell us about evolutionary history so we will remove them. We also don’t have information for all sites for all species, so when we lack a lot of information we’ll remove those as well. Put the data together. At this point you have an alignment of sites. Each row is a species. Each column is a particular site in the genome. You can see your output alignments in the SISRS_Run folder of your output folder. They will be labeled alignment_pi_m5 (or similar). You can view the first part of each file using head followed by the file name.

First, we’ll use software that calculates the likelihood that the data fit the phylogeny. The software will try lots of different phylogenies and pick the case where the data are most likely.

Four species are much easier to work with than more as there are only three possible ways these species can be related. We can look at how often the grouping of sites matches each hypotheized why species are related. You can read the full explanation (with visuals) but don’t worry if it’s complicated. This method is implemented in SVDQuartets. Change the necessary files and information in runSVDQ.sh and submit it. Download and examine your results. 8.6 Alternative methods of support The bootstrap approach automatically implemented by RAxML is one method of determining support. However, bootstrap resampling can have limitations when using larger datasets. An alternative approach is to examine the proportion of sites that support each alternative hypothesis given a tree, similar to the SVDQ approach. You can calculate SCF support by editing the runSCF.sh script and inputing your tree and your alignment. If you estimated different trees using the above methods you may try more than one.
